Every change in the working directory is a diff from the last commit. Git add stages the changes, and git commit shows the differences and saves them into the repo. Each commit is like a recorded patch.","metadata":{}},{"id":"9aa99e0b-8fbe-4ccc-a728-b39b1fda153c","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Question 3\n#### What is the difference between a branch and a fork?\nA branch is the history of the code, the linear series of commits, and the branch points to the commit. A fork is a copy of a repository that is permanently separate from the original. This is different from the branch, because the branch is temporary and a part of the same repository.

What’s the difference?\nThey are closely related because they both work to track and apply changes between files. diff compares two versions of a file and displays the differences between them, which can be done using -u. The patch command takes the file with the displayed differences and applies the changes to the original version, creating an updated version.

Why?\nRebase is the better option because they are working collaboratively, which allows the commit history to follow a linear pathway, which eases readability. In addition, a rebase is better when you are trying to rewrite code by putting two together, which is the case in this scenario.
