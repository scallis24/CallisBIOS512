#b) Scaling and centering data is generally good practice before performing a PCA, because the PCA is a rotation, and you want to rotate around the center of the data.
It is especially important when the variable importance is unknown and there are consistently occurring spikes, like in the wine data. The summary statistic showed large variation
between values for the different variables, like Proline (values in the 1000s) and Hue (values less than 1). Without scaling, this would lead the PCA to cause unequal variance, even
though the importance of the variables is unknown. Thus by scaling and centering each variable will have equal variance to the principal components, and the ability to analyze the data 
based on true variance, not magnitude.
